      <t>The security model of the web platform has evolved over time to meet
      the needs of new applications and to correct earlier mistakes.
      Although web security has evolved largely organically, the security
      model has converged towards a handful of key concepts.  This document
      presents those concepts and provides advice to designers of new pieces
      of the web platform.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="trust" title="Trust">
      <t>On the web, trust is specified by URL.  For example, HTML documents
      designate which script to run with a URL:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[ 
<script src="https://example.com/library.js"></script>
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>When a user agent process this element, the user agent will fetch
      the script at that URL and execute the script with the privileges of
      the document.  In this way, the document grants all the privileges it
      has to the resource specified by the URL.  In essence, the document
      declares that it trusts the integrity of information retrieved from
      that URL.</t>

      <t>In addition to importing libraries from URLs, user agents also let
      principals export data to URLs.  For example, consider the HTML form
      element:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[ 
<form method="POST" action="https://example.com/login">
 ... <input type="password"> ...
</form>
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>When the user enters his or her password and submits the form, the
      password is sent to the network endpoint designated by the URL.  In
      this way, the document exports its secret data to that URL.  In
      essence, the document declares that it trusts the confidentiality of
      information sent to that URL.</t>

      <section title="Pitfalls">
        <t> When designing new pieces of the web platform, make sure that
        important trust distinctions are visible in URLs.  For example, if both
        TLS and non-TLS protected resources used the "http" URL scheme, a
        document would be unable to specify that it wished to retrieve a script
        over TLS.  By using the "https" URL scheme, documents are able to
        indicate that they wish to interact with resources that are protected
        from active network attackers.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="origin" title="Origin">
      <t>In principle, user agents could treat every URL as a separate
      principal and isolate each document from every other URL unless the
      document explicitly indicated that it trusted that URL.  Unfortunately,
      this design is cumbersome for developers because web applications often
      consist of a number of resource acting in concert.</t>

      <t>As an approximation, user agents group URLs together into protection
      domains called origins.  In particular, two URLs are part of the same
      origin (i.e., represent the same principal) if they have the same scheme,
      host, and port.</t>

      <t>Q: Why not just use the host?</t>

      <t>A: Including the scheme in the origin tuple is essential for security.
      If user agents did not include the scheme, there would be no isolation
      between documents from http://example.com and https://example.com because
      the two have the same host.  However, without this isolation, an active
      network attacker could corrupt the document retrieved from
      http://example.com and then use that document as a stepping stone to
      compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the document retrieved
      from https://example.com, bypassing the protections afforded by TLS.</t>

      <t>Q: Why use the fully qualified host name instead of just the
      "top-level" domain?</t>

      <t>A: Although the DNS has hierarchical delegation, the trust
      relationships between host names vary by deployment.  For example, at
      many educational institutions, students can host content at
      https://example.edu/~student/, but that does not mean a document authored
      by a student should be part of the same origin (i.e., represent the same
      principal) as a web application for managing grades hosted at
      https://grades.example.edu/.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="authority" title="Authority">
    <t>Although user agents group URLs into origins, not every resource in an
      origin carries the same authority.  For example, an image is passive
      content and, therefore, carries no authority, meaning the image has no
      access to the objects and resources available to its origin.  By
      contrast, an HTML document contains active content and, therefore,
      carries the full authority of its origin.  The user agent determines how
      much authority to grant a resource by examining its MIME type.  For
      example, resources with a MIME type of image/png are treated as images
      and resources with a MIME type of text/html are treated as HTML
      documents.</t>

      <t>When hosting untrusted content (such as user-generated content), web
      applications can limit that content’s authority by restricting its MIME
      type.  For example, serving user-generated content as image/png is less
      risky than serving user-generated content as text/html.  Of course many
      web applications incorporate untrusted content in their HTML documents.
      If not done carefully, these applications risk leaking their origin’s
      authority to the untrusted content, a vulnerability commonly known as
      cross-site scripting.</t>

      <section title="Pitfalls">
        <t>When designing new pieces of the web platform, be careful not to
        grant authority to resources irrespective of MIME type.  Many web
        applications serve untrusted content with restricted MIME types.  A
        new web platform feature that grants authority to these pieces of
        content risks introducing vulnerabilities into existing applications.
        Instead, prefer to grant authority to MIME types that already possess
        the origin’s full authority or to new MIME types designed specifically
        to carry the new authority.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="policy" title="Policy">
      <t>Generally speaking, user agents isolate different origins and permit
      controlled communication between origins.  The details of how user agents
      provide isolation and communication vary depending on several
      factors.</t>

      <section title="Object Access">
        <t>Most objects (also known as application programming interfaces or
        APIs) exposed by the user agent respect the same-origin policy.
        Specifically, a script running on behalf of one document can access
        objects associated with another document if, and only if, the two
        documents belong to the same origin, e.g., were retrieved from URLs
        with the same scheme, host, and port.</t>

        <t>There are some exceptions to this general policy.  For example, some
        parts of HTML’s Location interface are available across origins (e.g.,
        to allow for navigating other browsing contexts).  As another sample,
        HTML’s postMessage interface is visible across origins to facilitate
        cross-origin communication.  Exposing objects to foreign origins is
        dangerous and should be done only with great care because doing so
        exposes these objects to potential attackers.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Network Access">
        <t>Access to network resources varies depending on whether the
        resources are in the same origin as the document attempting to access
        them.</t>

        <t>Generally, reading information from another origin is forbidden.
        However, a document is permitted use some kinds of resources retrieved
        from other origins.  For example, a document is permitted to execute
        script, render images, and apply style sheets from any origin.
        Likewise, a document can display a document from another origin in a
        frame.</t>

        <t>Generally, sending information to another origin is permitted.
        However, sending information over the network in arbitrary formats is
        dangerous.  For this reason, user agents restrict documents to sending
        information using particular protocols, such as in an HTTP request
        without custom headers.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Pitfalls">
        <t>Whenever user agents allow documents from one origin to interact
        with resources in another origin, they invite security issues.  For
        example, the ability to display images from another origin leaks their
        height and width across origins.  Similarly, the ability to send
        network requests to another origin gives rise to cross-site request
        forgery vulnerabilities.  However, user agents tolerate these risks
        when the value proposition is high enough.  For example, a user agent
        that blocked cross-origin network requests would prevent its users from
        following hyperlinks, a core component of the web architecture.</t>

        <t>When designing new pieces of the web platform, it can be tempting to
        grant a privilege to one document but to withhold that privilege from
        another document in the same origin.  However, withholding privileges
        in this way is ineffective because the document without the privilege
        can usually obtain the privilege anyway because user agents do not
        isolate documents within an origin.  Instead, new pieces of the
        platform should grant or withhold privileges from origins as a whole
        (rather than discriminating between individual documents within an
        origin).</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="conclusion" title="Conclusion">
      <t>The web security model designates trust relationships with URLs.  URLs
      are grouped together into origins, which represent principals.  Some
      resources in an origin (active content) are granted the origin’s full
      authority, whereas other resources in the origin (passive content) are
      not granted the origin’s authority.  Documents that carry their origin’s
      authority are granted access to objects and network resources within
      their own origin.  These documents are also granted limited access to
      objects and network resources of other origins, but these cross-origin
      privileges must be carefully designed to avoid introducing security
      vulnerabilities into the web platform.</t>

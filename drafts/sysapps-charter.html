        <h1>[DRAFT] System Applications Working Group Charter</h1>
        <p>
          The mission of the <a href='http://www.w3.org/groups/system-apps/'>System Applications Working Group</a> is to
          define an runtime environment, security model, and associated APIs for building Web applications that integrate
          with a host operating system. While this runtime will have substantial overlap with the traditional browser-based
          runtime environment, it will have some important differences, being focused on Web applications that integrate
          more strongly with the host platform rather than traditional hosted web sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This working group differs from both the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/'>Web Applications Working Group</a>
          and the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/'>Device APIs Working Group</a> in that those working groups are
          focused on defining APIs that are safe to run in a browser environment. The work of these groups is
          complementary to the work of this group, but this working group will focus on functionality that is
          not necessarily appropriate for the "browse-by" web.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The System Applications Working Group aims to produce a runtime environment and a set of APIs
          that let applications integrate closely with the operating system's functionality using nothing
          but the Web platform. Creating the ability to produce applications relying solely on the web
          platform extends the reach of the Web to new places and opens the door to greater cooperation
          between the Web and the operating system.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class='scope' id='scope'>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of the System Applications Working Group covers the technologies related to developing
          Web application that integrate closely with a host operating system, including a runtime environment
          (with both an execution model and a security model) as well as markup vocabularies and application
          programming interfaces for describing and controlling the applications interaction with the host
          operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The working group will focus on those operating system interactions that cannot necessarily be exposed safely
          to Web applications executing in the traditional browser security model. The working group will
          consider a broad category of host operating systems, including those running on desktop
          computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices (MIDs), cellular phones, TVs, cameras,
          and other connected devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priority will be given to developing simple and consensual APIs, leaving more complex
          features to future versions. The group should adopt, refine and when needed, extend,
          existing practices where possible. The Working Group should also take into account
          the fact that some deliverables will most likely be tied to widely deployed platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group is expected to deliver APIs optimised for use with JavaScript. If relevant, the group may
          consider producing additional bindings for other languages in cooperation with the organisations responsible
          for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group’s deliverables must address issues of <strong><em>accessibility</em></strong>,
          <strong><em>internationalization</em></strong>, <strong><em>mobility</em></strong>,
          <strong><em>security</em></strong> and <strong><em>privacy</em></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, comprehensive test suites will be developed for each specification to ensure
          interoperability, and the group will create interoperability reports. The group will also
          maintain errata as required for the continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications
          it produces.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>
            To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to have two independent
            implementations of all features defined in the specification, including implementation on a
            constrained device (e.g. mobile phone, TV, camera).

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <section id='rec-track'>
          <h3>Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            The working group will deliver the specifications listed below. In a number of cases, pointers have
            been provided to existing documents that address requirements similar to those of given deliverables.
            These are provided solely as aids to the reviewing process and should not presume that the cited documents
            will be submitted to W3C or that the deliverable developed by the group will take one of these for its starting
            point. In some cases, links are not provided. This should not be taken to entail that there is no prior
            work on this item, but simply that it may not be available in a form suitable for linking (in some of those
            cases further information can be obtained through the <a href='https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI'>B2G WebAPI document</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The working group's deliverables are divided into two phases. Initially, the working group will focus
            on deliverables in the first phase in order to establish patterns and conventions that will be used
            for the remaining deliverables. The working group does not necessarily need to complete work on the
            phase 1 deliverables before working on deliverables in phase 2. However, the working group should make
            some substantial progress on some of the phase 1 deliverables before working on phase 2 deliverables.

          </section>
          <p>
            Note that where applicable, the group is free to split the above deliverables into several smaller specifications
            that collectively address the same space, or conversely to join some of the above into a single specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where practical, the API specifications should use the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/'>Web IDL</a>
            formalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification must contain a section detailing any known security and privacy implications for implementors,
            authors, and end users. The Working Group will actively seek security and privacy review on all its specifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group may also enter into joint Task Forces with other groups (in particular with the
            Web Applications and Device APIs Working Groups), to collaborate on the deliverables above if
            specifications cross group boundaries.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary to ensure the
            specification’s robustness, consistency, and implementability, and to promote interoperability
            between User Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test suite, which
            should be completed by the end of the Last Call phase, and must be completed, with an
            implementation report, before transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation.
            Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the Recommendation track, and the
            maintenance of a implementation report is encouraged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group may also document in a Working Group Note the useful design patterns shared by
            the APIs it is developing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other non-normative documents may be created such as:
          </p>
          <ul id='ig-other-deliverables'>
            <li>Primers for each specification</li>
            <li>Requirements and use case document for specifications</li>
            <li>Schemas for languages developed by the group (if any)</li>
            <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other working groups’ deliverables that
            are identified as being relevant to the Working Group’s mission.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id='milestones'>
          <h3>Milestones</h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will maintain an updated timeline of its deliverables on its home page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first priority will be to reach a consensus on the Security Model and the Execution Model, and
            to deliver First Public Working Drafts for these within the group's first quarter. Other deliverables
            can be worked on without waiting for these two documents to be final and polished. However, the design
            of APIs will depend on the the environment to which they are tailored, and it will be necessary to have
            a "checklist" consensus on the primary aspects of this environment that these two documents define.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the API deliverables in this charter already benefit from at least one and often several
            existing implementations. As such, once the preceding step is executed it is expected that the production
            of specifications building on strong implementation experience and existing documentation can proceed at
            the pace of five FPWDs per quarter (until Q2 of the second year). Each of these specifications is then
            expected to reach CR inside of three quarters, with transition to Recommendation status supported by the
            adaptation of tests from existing platforms to these specifications.

          <h3>W3C Groups</h3>
          <p>
            This Working Group’s specifications depend upon some specifications being developed by other

          <h3>External Groups</h3>
          <p>
            The following is a tentative list of external bodies the Working Group should collaborate with:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm' id='tc39'>Ecma International Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</a></dt>
            <dd>
              This is the group responsible for EcmaScript standardization, and related EcmaScript features like E4X. As this
              Working Group is developing EcmaScript APIs, it should collaborate with TC39.
            </dd>

      <section class='participation' id='participation'>
        <h2>Participation</h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, and
          to have the participation of the industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute one to two days per week towards the Working
          Group. There is no minimum requirement for other participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each specification the Working Group will name a Test Facilitator whose responsibility is to ensure that a
          Test Suite is made available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also decide to create task forces that allow
          more focused discussions for topics that require specific expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group welcomes participation from non-Members. The group encourages questions and comments on its
          public mailing list, <a href='mailto:public-system-apps@w3.org'>public-system-apps@w3.org</a>, which is
          <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-system-apps/'>publicly archived</a> and for which there is
          no formal requirement for participation. The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions
          for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under
          the W3C Patent Policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class='communication' id='communication'>
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the technical work of the group is done through discussions on the
          <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-system-apps/'>public-system-apps@w3.org</a>,
          the group’s public mailing list. Editors’ drafts and their editing history is available from a public W3C Web
          site. The group’s <i>action</i> and <i>issue</i> tracking data is also public, as are the participants-approved
          <i>minutes</i> from all teleconferences and meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general the Working Group does not hold teleconferences, but a teleconference can be scheduled occasionally
          at the chairs' discretion if a specific topic seems to warrant synchronous discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs
          and participants of the group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular participant requests such
          a discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants) is
          available from the <a href='http://www.w3.org/groups/system-apps/'>System Applications Working Group home page.</a>

      <section class='decisions' id='decisions'>
        <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>
          As explained in the W3C Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>),
          this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus and with due process. The expectation is that
          typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful
          consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the
          group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation—using, for example, email and/or web-based survey
          techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be considered resolved
          unless and until new information becomes available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asynchronous decisions that are attained through the mailing list, possibly using a “Call for Consensus”
          process are preferred, but synchronous decisions made during a teleconference or a face-to-face meeting
          are valid provided that the topic they address was clearly outlined in a public agenda posted one week
          earlier so that non-participating parties have a chance to voice their views ahead of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with <a href='http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes'>Section 3.4,
          Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
